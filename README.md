Mod that adds a variety of giant enemies, part of the forest keeper family.
## Credits

-Giant 3D models are inspired by fanart from flameburnt, with help from EveSculpts 2d to 3d tutorials.

-Based off of ExampleEnemy from Hamunii - https://github.com/Hamunii/LC-ExampleEnemy.

-Lots of initial setup help and coding advice also from Hamunii (Actual marriage material).

-Model Creation help from TiltedHat

-All custom sounds created by Moroxide and Pixel (Lethal Resonance creators), much love to them, check out their mod, it's small but it'll grow one day.

-AnimationEvent stuff taught briefly by IntegrityChaos (helped a lot with sync'ing audio etc).

-Mod-Release thread in the Lethal Company Modding Server for a lot of the ideas!

-New RedWood Giant model textures and material are created by meatballdemon on discord and https://twitter.com/_MeatBallDemon_ on twitter, fantastic work done (V1.4.0)!
