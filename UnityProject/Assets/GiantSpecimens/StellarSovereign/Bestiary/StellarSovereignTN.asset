  displayText: "Stellar Sovereign\n\nSigurd's danger level: 20%\n\nScientific name:
    Satyrid-Stella \n\nStellar Sovereigns get their name from their silhouettes blocking
    out the stars.\nDespite their large size, their hearts are said to be even bigger,
    the phrase, Heart of Gold comes to mind.\nThey do not attack, they do not eat,
    they have long since abandoned traditional methods for consumption.\nThey love
    their own kind more than anything, and will flood the world with their tears
    if they sense a loss of another.\nTheir compassion is second to none, they've
    been seen averting natural disasters on rare occasions, the true guardian of
    the planet in which they reside in."
